# atm-in-java
Java console-based ATM application simulating core banking operations. Users can securely deposit money, withdraw funds, and check their account balance. Simple, interactive, and designed using object-oriented programming principles.
# ATM in Java

**ATM in Java** is a simple console-based application that simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is designed to provide a practical example of how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts can be implemented in Java, while keeping the program interactive and easy to understand for beginners.  

The application allows users to perform three core banking operations:  
1. **Deposit Money** – Users can add funds to their account.  
2. **Withdraw Money** – Users can withdraw money, with checks in place to prevent overdrawing.  
3. **Check Balance** – Users can view their current account balance at any time.  

This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice Java programming in a real-world context. It introduces essential programming concepts such as classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, and conditional logic. The project is structured in a way that separates concerns: the `Account` class manages account details and operations, the `ATM` class handles user interaction and transactions, and the `Main` class initializes the program and runs the ATM interface.  

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Console-based, simple menu system for easy navigation.  
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Demonstrates encapsulation and method usage in Java.  
- **Secure Transactions:** Withdrawals are limited to the available balance.  
- **Interactive Learning:** Excellent hands-on practice for beginner Java developers.
